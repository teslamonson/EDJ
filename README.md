T.M. MONSON, D. FECKER, M. SCHERRER. NEUTRAL EVOLUTION OF HUMAN ENAMEL-DENTINE JUNCTION MORPHOLOGY. PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES U.S.A. (2020). <p>
Of the skeleton, teeth have the strongest genetic signature and thus great potential for reconstructing evolutionary processes involved in human origins directly from the fossil record. The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) is especially important, because it is more frequently preserved and somewhat decoupled from dietary function. Researchers have used the EDJ to test hypotheses of human evolution, but this trait has not yet been comprehensively studied across modern human populations. This study is the largest investigation of EDJ morphology in modern humans to date, spanning 161 archaeological individuals from six continents. These data demonstrate that the EDJ evolves neutrally, and biomedical imaging of EDJ morphology can therefore be used as a non-invasive method to investigate ancient population movement and human genetic structure.
